* The vast majority of Objective-C developers are familiar with the use of nil to indicate a nonexistent value,but communicating that kind of information through a variable’s type is a bit more foreign.
* In Objective-C, nil is a pointer to a non-existent object. 
* In Swift, nil is not a pointer—it is the absence of a value of a certain type. Optionals of any type can be set to nil , not just object types. 
* NULL has no equivalent in Swift. 
* nil is also called nil in Swift.
