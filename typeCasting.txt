Typecasting is the process of passing on your extra knowledge to Swift – a way of saying “that thing you thought was an X is actually a Y”. Swift won’t let you typecast completely unrelated types, which means you can’t say things like “that thing you thought was a string is actually an integer”, but is instead mainly used for subclasses.

example:

let vc = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "Detail") as? DetailViewController

- That as? is a typecast - we’re passing on to Swift the knowledge that the view controller we expect to be created is in fact a DetailViewController. 
- If the typecast fails then vc will be nil, but if it succeeds then Swift will be able to use it as a DetailViewController.

is - This operator returns a Boolean value indicating whether or not the value is of a certain data type.
as - This operator converts a value of one class to another class when possible.

as convert the object with the as operator to be able to access their properties and methods.
The operator as converts a value of one type to another.
